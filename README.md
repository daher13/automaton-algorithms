# Automaton Algorithms in Racket

This repository contains Racket implementations of various automaton algorithms, demonstrating the application of formal language theory and automata theory using the Racket programming language.

## Features

- **Finite Automata**: Implementations of deterministic and non-deterministic finite automata.
- **Regular Expressions**: Algorithms for converting regular expressions to finite automata.
- **Language Recognition**: Functions to recognize languages accepted by finite automata.
- **Minimization**: Algorithms for minimizing deterministic finite automata.

## Files

- `automaton.rkt`: Core implementations of automaton algorithms.
- `automaton-bkp.rkt`: Backup of earlier versions of automaton algorithms.
- `main.rkt`: Entry point to execute and test the automaton algorithms.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daher13/automaton-algorithms.git
```

## Usage
To run the main program, execute the main.rkt file:
```bash
racket main.rkt
```
This will execute the automaton algorithms and display the results.
